The Weather App Update is a simple and responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides users with real-time weather updates for any location. It fetches data from a weather API and displays key details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

Users can search by city name and instantly get the latest weather report. The app features a modern, user-friendly interface, with dynamic icons and background changes based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny day, rainy night).
